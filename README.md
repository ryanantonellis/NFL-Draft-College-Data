# NFL-Draft-College-Data

  This app is A visual representation of the top NCAA football programs in the past decade with regards to amount of NFL drafted 
talent. This app does not consider programs whose players have gone on to play in the NFL via the undrafted free agent (UDFA) route.
Each year has 30 corresponding markers geocoded onto the map.  The markers are present in a given year if that particular school was
in the top 30 for that year in terms of number of draftees.  Any ties gave priority to the schools that were less often represented
by the list e.g. Syracuse.  Each marker has a feature which displays the name of the school if hovered over.  This was done because
the points can get jumbled and tough to distinguish in certain areas, or when the slider input is set to 30.  There is also a built
in toggle feature to play with the map extensively.  Finally, the size of the markers represent the number of draft picks for the 
given year, and the sizes are proportional. 

  The second tab includes a stacked bar graph which displays the total number of draft picks for the top 10 programs of the decade.
The segments to the bars signify how many of a given team's draft picks were taken in the first 5 year period, or the second 5 year
period of the past decade.  This was done to attempt to show some trends that were not obvious from the map, and to highlight the 
top programs in terms of NFL talent.  

  It is fairly obvious to College football fans that these top 10 schools have some of the most on-field success, so it wasn't my 
goal to represent how NFL talent translated to wins.  Moreover, it was to showcase the change over time in the geographical areas that
had programs with the most NFL draftees.  My hypothesis was that the West, particularly the Pac-12, would have the largest decline in
the time frame given.  My second hypothesis was that over the course of the decade, the greatest improvements would be seen in the
Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern areas.  Neither of these trends can be fully supported by the data, but I believe that my second hypoth-
esis is able to be seen, to an extent, with regards to the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.  I hope you enjoy exploring these trends in my
app!
